The development of an IoT-based Smoke and Gas Detection system using Blynk IoT involves  integrating sensors like the MQ-2 (for smoke and gas detection) with a microcontroller, such  as Arduino. 
The development of an IoT-based Smoke and Gas Detection System aims to enhance safety by 
providing real-time monitoring and instant alerts for smoke and gas hazards. Traditional smoke 
and gas detection systems only provide local warnings, but with the integration of IoT 
technology, users can receive notifications remotely, ensuring quick responses even if they are 
not present at the location. This project utilizes Blynk IoT, a user-friendly platform for creating 
mobile applications that interface with IoT devices, to offer real-time data monitoring and 
alerts. By incorporating sensors such as the MQ-2, which detects smoke and various gases, the 
system is capable of detecting potential dangers early. 
When smoke or gas is detected, the system sends notifications through the Blynk app, as well 
as SMS and email alerts via services like or SMTP, keeping users informed at all times. This 
development ensures that individuals can take preventive actions promptly, significantly 
reducing the risk of accidents in homes, industries, and other sensitive environments. The 
system is cost-effective, scalable, and highly reliable, making it ideal for diverse applications.
